   <br>
    <h3>Here are some Symtoms!!</h3>
    <p>The main symptoms are as following--</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Coughing</li>
        <li>Shortness of breathing</li>
        <li>Trouble Breathing</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Chills,something with shaking</li>
        <li>Body ache</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Runny nose</li>
        <li>Loss of smell and taste</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
    </ul>

    <p2>The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs. In some cases, lung transplants have been needed.<br>

    If you notice the following severe symptoms in yourself or a loved one, get medical help right away:</p2>
    <ul>
        <li>Trouble breathing or shortness of breathing</li>
        <li>Ongoing chest pain or Pressure</li>
        <li>Confusion</li>
        <li>Can't walk up fully</li>
        <li>Bluish lips or face</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p3>Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19. Remember FAST:</p3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Face</h4>Is one side of the person's face numb or drooping? Is their smile lopsided?</li>
        <li><h4>Arms</h4>Is one arm weak or numb? If they try to raise both arms, does one arm sag?</li>
        <li><h4>Speech</h4>Can they speak clearly? Ask them to repeat a sentence.</li>
        <li><h4>Time</h4>Every minute counts when someone shows signs of a stroke. Call 911 right away.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p4>If you're infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14. It varies from person to person.<br>

        According to researchers in China, these were the most common symptoms among people who had COVID-19:</p4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fever 99%</li>
        <li>Fatigue 70%</li>
        <li>Cough 59%</li>
        <li>Lack of appetite 40%</li>
        <li>Body ache 35%</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath 31%</li>
        <li>Mucus/phlegm 27%</li>
    </ul>
    <p5>Some people who are hospitalized for COVID-19 also have dangerous blood clots, including in their legs, lungs, and arteries.</p5>        
    <h2>What to do if you think you have it</h2>
    <p6>If you live in or have traveled to an area where COVID-19 is spreading:</p6>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>If you don't feel well, stay home</h3>Even if you have mild symptoms like a headache and runny nose, stay in until you're better. This lets doctors focus on people who are more seriously ill and protects health care workers and people you might meet along the way. You might hear this called self-quarantine. Try to stay in a separate room away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom if you can.</li>
        <li><h3>Call the doctor if you have trouble breathing</h3>You need to get medical help as soon as possible. Calling ahead (rather than showing up) will let the doctor direct you to the proper place, which may not be your doctor's office. If you don't have a regular doctor, call your local board of health. They can tell you where to go for testing and treatment.</li>
        <li><h3>Follow your doctor's advice and keep up with the news on COVID-19.</h3>Between your doctor and health care authorities, you'll get the care you need and information on how to prevent the virus from spreading.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>How do I know if it's COVID-19, a cold, or the flu?</h2>
    <p7>Symptoms of COVID-19 can be similar to a bad cold or the flu. Your doctor will suspect COVID-19 if:</p7>
    <ul>
        <li>You have a fever and a cough.</li>
        <li>You have been exposed to people who have it within the last 14 days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Coronavirus Risk Factors</h2>
    <p8>Anyone can get COVID-19, and most infections are mild. The older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness.<br>

        You also a have higher chance of serious illness if you have one of these health conditions:</p8>
        <ul>
            <li>Chronic kidney disease</li>
            <li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>
            <li>A weakened immune system because of an organ transplant</li>
            <li>Obesity</li>
            <li>Serious heart conditions such as heart failure or coronary artery disease</li>
            <li>Sickle cell disease</li>
            <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
            <p9>Conditions that could lead to severe COVID-19 illness include:</p9>
            <li>Moderate to severe asthma</li>
            <li>Diseases that affect your blood vessels and blood flow to your brain</li>
            <li>Cystic fibrosis</li>
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
            <li>A weakened immune system because of a blood or bone marrow transplant, HIV, or medications like corticosteroids</li>
            <li>Dementia</li>
            <li>Liver disease</li>
            <li>Pregnancy</li>
            <li>Damaged or scarred lung tissue (pulmonary fibrosis)</li>
            <li>Smoking</li>
            <li>Thalassemia</li>
            <li>Type 1 diabetes</li>
            <li>Depression</li>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>Schizophrenia</li>
        </ul>
        <p9>Some children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids' blood vessels.</p9>
    <h2>How Are Mood Disorders Linked to Severe COVID-19?</h2>   
    <p10>One large study reviewed 91 million people with mood disorders and other mental health conditions. It found that if you have preexisting mood disorders, you're at a high risk for hospitalization or death but not necessarily severe COVID-19.<br>

        According to the study, there are several socio-economic reasons why preexisting mood disorders can increase your chances for hospitalization and death if you get COVID-19.</p10><br>
    <p11>This include:</p11> 
    <ul>
        <li>Poverty</li>
        <li>Lack of access to preventative</li>
        <li>Ability to understand health recommendations</li>
        <li>Lack of acess to affordable health care </li>
        <li>Living in tight spaces or facilities like nursing homes,homeless shelters,prisons,or psychiatric</li>
        
    </ul> 
    <p12>In addition, people living with mental health conditions may have certain mood disorder symptoms that can interfere with our ability to care for ourselves and be engaged in our health. This can make it hard to effectively follow health behaviors like maintaining social distance or staying in quarantine to reduce the spread of the infection.<br>

        Moreover, people with mental health and mood disorders are also more likely  to have conditions like diabetes and heart problems that are major risk factors for severe COVID-19.<br>
        
        Another study looked at 7,348 people with preexisting mood and psychiatric conditions with confirmed COVID-19 infections. It found those living with schizophrenia were more than twice as likely to die from COVID-19. Study experts noted that possible delay in access to health care and other unknown or monitored health risk factors may have led to the higher death rate.</p12> 
    <h3>Coronavirus Diagnosis</h3> 
    <p13>Call your doctor or local health department if you think you've been exposed and have symptoms like:</p13>   
    <ul>
        <li>Fever of 100 F or higher</li>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Trouble breathing </li>
    </ul>   
    <p14>Testing facilities readily available in most areas. While some require an appointment, others are simply drive-up. Home testing kits are also widely available.<br><br>

        A swab test is the most common testing method. It looks for signs of the virus in your upper respiratory tract. You or the person giving the test puts a swab up your nose to get a sample from the back of your nose and throat. That sample usually goes to a lab that looks for viral material, but some areas may have rapid tests that give results in as little as 15 minutes.<br><br>
        
        If there are signs of the virus, the test is positive. A negative test could mean there is no virus or there wasn't enough to measure. That can happen early in an infection. It usually takes 24 hours to get results, but the tests must be collected, stored, shipped to a lab, and processed.<br><br>
        
        The FDA granted emergency-use authorizations for tests that include home nasal swab tests, which you collect yourself and express ship back to the lab for analysis. The agency also approved several at-home rapid tests. You can buy these over the counter in pharmacies, at retail stores, or online -- but kits that give you rapid results (within minutes) can sometimes be hard to find due to high demand. At-home tests are also available for free at some local health departments or federally qualified health centers.<br><br>

        A swab test can only tell whether you have the virus in your body at that moment. But you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether  you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus.<br><br>

        The FDA is working with laboratories across the country to develop more tests.<br><br>
